SIDMT (Sistem Informasi Data Menara Telekomunikasi/System Information for Telecomunication Tower Registration)
=====

A web-based application to monitor the tower registration and validity period of permit. 
The tower location will be showed on the map. It is using by Department of Transportation of my local government. 
I used PHP, MySql, jQuery, jqGrid (for displaying data and CRUD) and Ajax to develop this software. 
I used PHPExcel library for reporting and converting data to Microsoft Excel format.
